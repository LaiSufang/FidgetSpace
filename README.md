# Fidget Space

This 9.0 .NET MAUI app was created as an alternative to physical fidget toys. Specifically, our target audience are adolescents that have trouble focusing in settings that request for no disruption. Teachers 
often see fidget toys as nuisance and overlook their benefits due to the sound they make. There are three games you can play on our app that are relaxing to play without needing to divulge too much attention 
or thought into playing them due to their simplistic design. We hope anyone who tries our app can feel our intentions and enjoy the games.
